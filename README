A collection of policies for contributing to open source projects.

To read the contribution policies, please refer to [CONTRIB][contrib.md].

Background
----------

It can sometimes be tricky to know how to contribute to an open source project. Likewise, it can be tricky as a maintainer to know which patches to accept and which to reject. This project aims to act as a blueprint for open source projects, providing a simple no nonsense set of policies for judging whether a patch should be merged or not.

The policies here generally won't talk about the quality of a patch. Rather, the point of these policies is to foster a collaborative spirit, where action speaks louder than words. Thus, the default action is to merge patches, unless sufficient evidence to reject it has been presented. This is the core tenet of this project, that evidence trumps opinion, even if said evidence is actually wrong. The hypothesis is that the likelyhood of patches being submitted is a consequence of the number of patches being merged; that is, if patches are more likely to be merged it is more likely that people will contribute new patches. If contributions are stuck in argument ad nauseam, it's more like to deter other contributions.

This project came about as a direct result of Drew Crawford's excellent op-ed [Conduct Unbecoming of a Hacker][drew], which is highly recommended reading. In the article, Mr. Crawford argues that the argumentative nature of the hacker community, where people will argue until they run out of air and essentially get nowhere, is a relatively new phenomenon; whereas in earlier days the arguments were generally underpinned by patches or the arguments themselves were patches. As such, the culture was more evidence based, a kind of put-up-or-shut-up culture. I believe this to be wholly necessary for computer *science* as a field of work and research to progress, and opinion should be left at the door.

This project owes its existance to Mr. Crawford, and is eminently grateful to his excellent effort.
